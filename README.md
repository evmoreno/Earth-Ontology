ADT DTDL Models the earth


Classes:

Earth: The planet we live on.
Atmosphere: The layer of gases that surrounds the Earth.
Lithosphere: The solid, outermost layer of the Earth.
Hydrosphere: The water on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere.
Biosphere: All living things on Earth and their interactions with the other spheres.
Properties:

hasAtmosphere: Relates the Earth to its atmosphere.
hasLithosphere: Relates the Earth to its lithosphere.
hasHydrosphere: Relates the Earth to its hydrosphere.
hasBiosphere: Relates the Earth to its biosphere.
Subclasses:

Troposphere: The lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere, where weather occurs.
Stratosphere: The layer above the troposphere where the ozone layer is located.
Mesosphere: The layer above the stratosphere where meteors burn up.
Thermosphere: The layer above the mesosphere where the Northern and Southern Lights occur.
Exosphere: The outermost layer of the atmosphere, where gases gradually thin out and merge with space.
Crust: The outermost layer of the lithosphere.
Mantle: The layer of the Earth between the crust and the core.
Core: The innermost layer of the Earth, consisting of a solid inner core and a liquid outer core.
Ocean: A large body of saltwater that covers most of the Earth's surface.
Lake: A body of water surrounded by land.
River: A natural waterway that flows towards the ocean.
Glacier: A large mass of ice that moves slowly over land.
Forest: A large area covered in trees and undergrowth.
Grassland: An area covered in grass and other non-woody plants.
Desert: A dry, arid region with little precipitation.
Mountain: A large landform that rises steeply above its surroundings.
Relations:

isPartOf: Relates a subclass to its superclass.
isLocatedIn: Relates a subclass to its location within the Earth.
interactsWith: Relates the biosphere to the other spheres of the Earth.
